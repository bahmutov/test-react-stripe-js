TODO:
- âœ… add iframe commands to reach into the Stripe's iframe to type the CC number
- [ ] figure out why I cannot spy or stub `stripe.createPaymentMethod` method. Seems there is a weird getter that does not allow setting new method property
- [ ] figure out XHR interception against the Stripe's API
